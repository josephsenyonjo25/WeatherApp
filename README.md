This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The React Weather App Project

Say you are planning to travel or even go to the beach over the weekend. Weather can impact your plans adversely. This weather page provides you forecasts not only currently but also over a number of days.
It is a good tool!

The project was inspired by other weather applications. The data is fetched from https://www.metaweather.com/api/. I utilize React-Router for dynamic routing, and Context API to manage State, passed to the children via the Provider which wraps the parent components.

The project is still a work-in-progress in terms of styling and more functionality. I will improve on it over time.
